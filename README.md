# FaceDetection
This project demonstrates face detection using machine learning techniques in Python. It detects faces in images and marks their locations with a green bounding box.
Features:
Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate face detection.
Provides bounding box coordinates around detected faces.
Limitations may occur in certain lighting conditions or when faces are partially obscured.
Technologies Used: Python and OpenCV library for image processing
